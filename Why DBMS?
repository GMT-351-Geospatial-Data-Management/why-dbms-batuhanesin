- What is the DataBase Management System (DBMS) ?

   DBMS is a database program. Technically speaking, it is a software system that uses a standard method of cataloging, retrieving, and running queries on data.
The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides ways for the data to be modified or extracted by users or other programs.

   Some DBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, FileMaker, Oracle, RDBMS, dBASE, Clipper, and FoxPro. 
Since there are so many database management systems available, it is important for there to be a way for them to communicate with each other. 
For this reason, most database software comes with an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver that allows the database to integrate with other databases. 
For example, common SQL statements such as SELECT and INSERT are translated from a program's proprietary syntax into a syntax other databases can understand.

- Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet? and What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)?

   Spreadsheet applications are commonly used to manage environmental data. These software programs are helpful organizational tools but have limitations compared to a real database.
Spreadsheets are inherently simpler to understand and are more familiar to most people than a database.
While there are similarities between a spreadsheet and a database, a spreadsheet is not a database. 
These two separate software tools are complementary and are frequently used in tandem. Often the information stored in a database is exported to a spreadsheet to provide an orderly, formatted view or perform additional calculations.
   
   Let's understand more why we need a Database Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet by looking at the ADVANTAGES of DBMS over spreadsheet.

-DATA VOLUME

How much data is being collected? For long-term projects with numerous monitoring locations, millions of data points can be generated. 
Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle volumes of information that would be unmanageable in a spreadsheet. 
Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not. Compared to databases, spreadsheets can require a large amount of hard-drive space for data storage.
When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data, the spreadsheet can be hard to read. Finding specific data can be cumbersome. 
Relational databases use querying tools to overcome these issues.

-EDITING

Updates to databases are typically easier than spreadsheets, especially if the same information is maintained in multiple records or multiple spreadsheets.

-DATA ACCESSIBILITY and SPEED

Databases provide a flexibility to sort and present data in a myriad of ways that would be nearly impossible to do with two-dimensional spreadsheets.
Many databases also provide means to automate query and report generation using stored procedures.

Data in separate spreadsheets cannot be easily compared and analyzed. Decisions based on these disparate sets of information can be flawed. 
When data are maintained in a centralized relational database, data is easily accessible for querying, analysis, and reporting. 
Since the database will enforce the same quality standards for any dataset, decisions can be made with confidence.

Databases are designed to refer to information without loading all the information into memory, unlike spreadsheets. 
Therefore, databases operate faster than spreadsheets when handling large datasets. And spreadsheets have memory limitations.

-DATA INTEGRITY

Data integrity is a key difference between databases and spreadsheets. 
Relational databases follow standardized integrity rules to ensure that the data they contain are accurate and accessible. 
Database fields can be restricted to specific data types, formats, and/or lengths. Referential integrity is the collective set of rules that ensures consistent and valid data within the database, including use of primary keys and establishing relationships between data tables. 
Use of valid values or reference values can further restrict data and prevent data entry errors.

-REDUNDANCY

The database structure also avoids data redundancy. Since the data in different database tables are linked, there is little or no duplication of source data. 
Frequently data in spreadsheets are copied multiple times and the same data are maintained in separate spreadsheet files, creating a nightmare to ensure accurate data when a change is required.

-ERROR PROLIFERATION

Preventing and efficiently identifying data errors in spreadsheets is harder than databases.

-USER ACCESS and SECURITY

Unlike spreadsheets, modern relational databases are designed for multiple users. Databases are ideal for sharing and collaboration of information.
Databases provide centralized data storage and offer better security. User permissions can be assigned to view data, edit data, and restrict access to privileged information.
